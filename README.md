# Multivariate_Spatio_Temporal_Model
This repository contains the data and code used for the analyses in the paper "A multivariate spatio-temporal model for the incidence of imported COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths in Cuba".

In the "data" folder, the data that were used for the analyses can be found together with the files necessary to create maps of Cuba in R.

The "R scripts" folder contains the R scripts that were used for fitting the univariate and multivariate models together with the R script for the exploratory data analysis.
